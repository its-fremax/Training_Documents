	- What is DevOps ???
	
	SDLC : Software Development Life Cycle :
	
		- Requirement Analysis 
	
		- Designg & Document 
		
		- Code & Development 
		
		- Testing 
		
		- Implement to Prod
		
		- Monitor/Maintain 
		
		
	- Waterfall: 
		- It is Linear in fashion.
		- It strictly follows Top-Down Approach
	
		- Requirement Analysis 
	
		- Designg & Document 
		
		- Code & Development 
		
		- Testing 
		
		- Implement to Prod
		
		- Monitor/Maintain 	
		
		
	Software Applications :
	
		- Desktop Applications
		- Web Applications
		- Mobile Applications
		- Embedded Applications
	
	
			
		- Desktop Applications	:::
			
			SuperMarket Billing System:
					--> Functions/Modules 
							- User Interface Design 
							- Inventory Mgmt 
							- Billing Mgmt
							- Supplier Mgmt 
							- Payment Mgmt 
								- Cash Payment 
								- Card Payment
							
										- Online Payment
										- UPI Payment 
							
					
	Core Project :
	
		- Requirement Analysis 		--> 12 Months 
	
		- Designg & Document 
		
		- Code & Development 		--> 6th Month 
		
		- Testing 
		
		- Implement to Prod
		
		- Monitor/Maintain


	Enhancement Project :
	
		- Requirement Analysis 		
	
		- Designg & Document 
		
		- Code & Development 		
		
		- Testing 
		
		- Implement to Prod
		
		- Monitor/Maintain
		
		
	AGILE Methodologies :::
	
		- Desktop Applications	:::
			
			SuperMarket Billing System:
					--> Functions/Modules --> iterations  
							- User Interface Design 
							- Inventory Mgmt 
							- Billing Mgmt
							- Supplier Mgmt 
							- Payment Mgmt 
								- Cash Payment 
								- Card Payment		

							
										- Online Payment
										- UPI Payment 
										
	Iteration 1 : User Interface Design 
	
		- Requirement Analysis 		
	
		- Designg & Document 
		
		- Code & Development 		
		
		- Testing 
		
		- Implement to Prod with proper manual approvals
		
		- Monitor/Maintain
		
		
	Iteration 2 : Inventory Mgmt
	
		- Requirement Analysis 		
	
		- Designg & Document 
		
		- Code & Development 		
		
		- Testing 
		
		- Implement to Prod with proper manual approvals
		
		- Monitor/Maintain
		

	nth Iteration : Online Payment
	
		- Requirement Analysis 		
	
		- Designg & Document 
		
		- Code & Development 		
		
		- Testing 
		
		- Implement to Prod with proper manual approvals
		
		- Monitor/Maintain
		
		
	Using AGILE Methodologies:
	
	 - We can Achieve :
	 
		- Continuous Development
		- Continuous Integration 
		- Continuous Testing 
		- Continuous Delivery
			- Used to perform Production release with manual approvals.
		
	 - We cannot Achieve :
	 
		- Continuous Deployment 	
			- Used to perform Production release without any manual approvals.
			
			
	- What is DevOps ???
	
	- DevOps :::::
	
		DevOps is a Software Development Strategy, which helps to promote the collaboration between the teams like Development Team and Operations Team to achieve Continuous Development, Continuous Integration, Continuous Testing, Continuous Delivery, Continuous Deployment and Continuous Monitoring in more Automated Fashion.
		
			Continuous Delivery & Deployment:
			
				- Both Continuous Delivery & Continuous Deployment are used to release the changes from Non-Prod to Prod.
				
				Continuous Delivery:
				
					- Continuous Delivery Exepects Manual Approvals
					- We might experience the Application Down-time
	
					Eg: 
				
					Banking Domain :
					
						Online Banking / Credit Card Transaction
				
							Create a Production Release Window:
								4 - 6Hrs 
								
	
				Continuous Deployment:
				
					- Never Exepects Manual Approvals	
					- Deploy the changes to production without any down-time.

					Eg:
					
					- Amazon/Netflix/Facebook/Google ::
					
						
				
	
					
	- How to Implement DevOps :::
	
		- Identify the Teams involved in the process of SDLC :
		
			- DevOps Team 
				- Infra-Structure Management Team 
				- Application Development Team
				- Testing Team 
				- Release Management Team 
				- Production Support Team 
				- Production Monitoring Team 
				- IT Security 
				
				
		- Environments :
		
			Non-Prod 									Prod Environments
			
				Dev Environment
				
				Test Environment
				
					QA 
					
					UAT 			================>		Production Servers - 1,2,3,4,5
	
		
		
		- Application Architecture :
		
			- Monolith Application Architecture:
			
				- It Tightly-Coupled Application Architecture
				- All the dependencies are tightly coupled 
				- With the we can achieve only Continuous Delivery.
				- We cannot achieve Continuous Deployment
			
			
			- Micro-Service Based Application Architecture: 
			
				- It is Loose-Coupled Application Architecture,
				- Each and every function is considered as Micro-Service.
				- With this we can achieve Continuous Deployment.

	Git - Client install on Local Machine 
	
	Github - Remote Repository Server
	

	Working with Git :::
	
	
	Local Git Repository															Remote Git Repository
	
	
	

	
	Tracking/Versioning ?
	
	
	*.py 
	
	asdfasdf
	dfasdf
	asdfasdfasd
	----shion
	
	save myMLApp1.py		===> myMLApp1.py_v1.0
	
	save myMLApp1.py		===> myMLApp1.py_v1.1
	
	save myMLApp1.py		===> myMLApp1.py_v1.2

	save myMLApp1.py		===> myMLApp1.py_v1.3
	
	save myMLApp1.py		===> myMLApp1.py_v1.4		Latest version (Tag/Version_Number/Commit_ID)
	
	
	Git File Workflow :::

	Local Machine 																			Remote Server 
	
	Install git client 																			Github/AzRepo/gitlab
	
	Working_Directory 				Staging_Area 				Local_Repository				  Remote_Repsitory 
	
	 myMLApp1.py	 --------------> myMLApp1.py --------------> myMLApp1.py_v1.0 ----------------> myMLApp1.py_v1.0
						git add 					git commit						  git push
						
	 myMLApp1.py	 --------------> myMLApp1.py --------------> myMLApp1.py_v1.1 ----------------> myMLApp1.py_v1.1
						git add 					git commit						  git push
	
	


	Developer's Workload :
	
		Types of Projects:

			- Enhancement/Bugfix 
			- New Project 
			
	
	Git Cli Commands :
	
	
	git --version
	
	
	git clone 		:	To Clone/Copy the entire Remote Repository to Local Machine 
	
	git add 		:	To add the changes from Working Directory to Staging_Area
	
	git commit 		:	To commit the changes from Staging_Area to Local Repository
	
	git push 		:	To Push the Changes from Local Repository to Remote Repository
	
	git pull/Fetch 
		
		- Both git pull & git fetch are used to handle the incremental changes from Remote Repository
		
		- git Fetch :	
			To just check the incremental changes from remote repository. If any incremental changes exist, it will update the incremental changes only in the Local Repository. Not in the Working Directory.

		- git pull 	:
			Check the incremental changes from remote repository. If any incremental changes exist, it will update the incremental changes in the Local Repository as well in the Working Directory.

			As a best practise, always it is recommended to use git pull to keep the local repo in-sync with remote repository

				git pull = git fetch + git merge!
	
	git init 		:	To initialize a local git repository
						It will create a .git directory in the project workspace
						It will create a default branch called master/main
			
			
	Fork 			: 	To copy/backup a entire remote repository to another remote repository



	Work with Cli Commands :::
	
	Organize the WorkSpace :::
	
		cd d:

		mkdir MLProjects 
		
		cd MLProjects
		
		mkdir MLRepo1			# Workspace 
		
		mkdir MLRepo2
		
		cd MLRepo1
			git init 
	
	
		
	Local Machine 															
															
	
	Working_Directory 			Staging_Area 				Local_Repositor
	
	 file1.txt	 --------------> file1.txt --------------> file1.txt
					git add					git commit				
	
	
	
	git status			:	To Get the status of repository

	

	Git Configuration ::::
	
		As a best practise, using git global config to setup the user name and email after initializing the first local repository.
		
		Global Configuration:				# Applicable to all the Repositories
		
			git config --global user.name "LoksaiETA"
			
			git config --global user.email "loksai@asdf.com"

			git config --global --list
		
		Local Configuration:				# Applicable to a specific Repository
	
			git config user.name "LoksaiETA"
			
			git config user.email "loksai@asdf.com"	
			
			git config --list 
		
		
	git add ::::	
	
		git add file1.txt 

		git add file1.txt file2.txt
		
		git add *.doc 
		
		git add .							# . to select all files 
		


	git rm --cached 'file1.txt' 			# Unstage a file, the file changes will be back to working directory.
	
	git rm -f 'file1.txt' 					# Permantly Unstage and a delete a file from working directory.
